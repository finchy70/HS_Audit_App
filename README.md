# HS_Audit_App
Simple checkbox Audit with ability to add multiple audit questions, under multiple sections, and add colleagues to be audited. Score each audit and stores the results for historical look via the app using Sqlite3 database.  I'm using python and have only been learning this for just over a month (as of 17/06/2015) and wxpython as a gui front end.  I am a complete beginner with wxpython so any help is appreciated.
The App will initially run on desktop but will soon move to Windows Tablet so the ability to use completly via touch screen is required.
